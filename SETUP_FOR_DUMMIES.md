# Setup for Dummies

## Info
This guide is designed for people who do not understand what I mean and for dummies

## Getting Started
First, we'll need to setup the build of the game

**These are programs you'll need to install:**
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

_For MacOS users, I don't know how to install it. :D_

**Installation guide:**

1. Go back to the home page and click these provided with the picture below:

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/repo/download-repo-zip.png" width="500">
</div>

2. Place the .zip into your desired location and extract the .zip file

3. Open the folder which its name is identical of what you're downloading right now

4. Ignore the files window for a while, we need to download required programs to build the game (Windows only)

	- Once we download each required programs, place it to the folder you've downloaded earlier

		Don't freak out! These programs have no viruses in it (obviously)

		- [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v6.2.0)

		- [run-in-roblox](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/run-in-roblox/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

	- If you're MacOS or Linux user, please follow the instructions in their home page.

	**LINUX USERS ONLY:**

	- Once you're done, try copy this line below, paste it to the terminal window and press `Enter` on your keyboard:
	```bash
	rojo --help
	```

	- If it goes wrong, skip to Step 7 and return to Step 5, once it's done

5. Open the terminal program:

	**Windows:**

	- Hold `Shift` on your keyboard and right click inside the surroundings of the File Explorer (Make sure you have not selected anything).

		If you're in Windows 11, click Show more options once you see it.

	- Click `Open PowerShell window here` or `Open in Windows Terminal` (both options are fine)
	<div align="center">
	<img src="assets/repo/properties-on-windows.png" width="300">
	</div>

	- Once you're in PowerShell or Windows Terminal, copy below here, paste it to Windows Terminal or PowerShell and press `Enter` key on your keyboard:

	```ps
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
	```

	The reason why we need to execute this line because PowerShell disabled scripts by default which restricts us to build the game.

	**Linux**

	- Right click inside the surroundings in the Files window (Make sure you have not selected anything).

	- Click `Open in Terminal`

6. Install required packages:
	- Copy this below, paste it to the terminal window and press `Enter` key on your keyboard:

	```bash
	npm i -g roblox-ts@next
	```

	- To test this out, type `rbxtsc --help` and press enter.

		It should show like this:

	<div align="center">
	<img src="assets/repo/roblox-ts-help-line-output.png" width="400">
	</div>

7. **Linux users only (THIS IS NOT TESTED YET, TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK)**:

	If you've got an error, maybe because bash isn't recognized roblox-ts as an executable program.

	- To solve this issue, we need to copy this line below, paste it into the terminal window and press `Enter` on your keyboard:

	```bash
	nano ~/.bashrc
	```

	- Scroll all the way to the bottom by holding down arrow key on your keyboard

	- Press `Enter` key on your keyboard to give some extra line

	- Copy this line below, paste by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+V" on your keyboard in the terminal window (Be sure to replace YOUR_USERNAME with your username):


	```
	export PATH=$PATH:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.npmrc:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.foreman/bin:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.cargo/bin
	```

	- Close and open the terminal (same process as Step 5)

	- Try again in Step 6 or 5.

8. Compile the game:
	- Copy this line below, paste it to the terminal window and press `Enter` on your keyboard:

	```bash
	npm run build-game
	```

	- If it compiles successfully, you should see `game.rbxlx` file right into your Files window

	- Otherwise, please contact with me on Discord (memothelemo#1850) so that I can fix your issue

## FAQ

**Why does your code looks messy?:**

It is messy because it is not my fault.

It is automatically generated by roblox-ts, a package from Node.js converts from different language (known as TypeScript) to language that ROBLOX uses.

**Why do you use TypeScript instead of Lua?**

I know, I know, I know!

TypeScript allows me to never run into errors caused by typos, invalid values or passing the wrong type of the value.

If I were using Lua instead, I have to spend couple hours (where, why, what, and how it did happened)

**Why do I need to install these programs mentioned in the installation guide?**

If you haven't used Rojo before, you're very frustrated and don't think it is not beneficial to use other external code editors.

The purpose of these programs to improve my workflow when working my game.

I don't have to deal with these situations:

- ROBLOX Studio crashes which can lead to risk of losing my progress if I don't enabled auto-save.

- I can go back to my code where it is working if it is not working totally

- Predicting my code would work most of the time in the future.

- Ransomware, hacking or virus incidents

- If I decided to hire some scripters, my life would be definitely easier than Team Create.
